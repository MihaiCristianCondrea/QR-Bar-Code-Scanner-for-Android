# Style Guidance

- Follow official Java coding conventions.
- Prefer immutable `final` fields and keep methods small and focused.
- Name classes and files using `PascalCase`; use `camelCase` for methods and variables.
- Each file should end with a trailing newline.
- Build UI with XML layouts and reference Material 3 components for colors, typography, and spacing.
- Use Java concurrency utilities or libraries such as RxJava for asynchronous work and state streams.
- Inject dependencies with Hilt or Dagger; obtain ViewModels via standard `ViewModelProvider` helpers.
