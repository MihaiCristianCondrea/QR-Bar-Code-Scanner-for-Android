# QR & Bar Code Scanner for Android

**A fast, privacy-conscious scanner and generator built for everyday Android use.**

QR & Bar Code Scanner for Android provides a streamlined experience for reading and creating QR and
bar codes. Built with Kotlin and Material Design 3, the app pairs a modern interface with reliable
scanning powered by the [ZXing library](https://github.com/zxing/zxing). The app is lightweight,
open-source, and focused on keeping your scanning history on-device.

## Key capabilities

- **Instant scanning:** Detect QR codes, Data Matrix, Aztec, UPC, EAN, and other popular formats in
  real time using the in-app camera with optional torch and zoom controls for low-light or distant
  codes.
- **Create and export codes:** Turn text, links, Wi-Fi credentials, and more into shareable QR
  codes, then save them as PNG or SVG files.
- **Smart history:** Automatically store successful scans so you can revisit, favorite, or delete
  items whenever you need them.
- **One-tap follow-up actions:** Open web links with your preferred search engine, connect to Wi-Fi
  networks, add calendar events, or share contact information directly from the scan result.
- **Personalized experience:** Switch between light, dark, and dynamic Material You themes, adjust
  haptic and sound feedback, and tailor privacy, notification, and security preferences to match
  how you use the app.
- **Respectful monetization:** Banner ads only appear with user consent, and in-app updates and
  review prompts ensure you stay current without leaving the app.
